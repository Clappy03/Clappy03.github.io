<h2>Brazilain jiu jistu</h2>
<p> Brazilain jiu jistu is martial art thats based around ground fighting and submission holds.
it focuses on getting your opponent to the ground, controlling ones opponent and gain a dominant position to force them to "tap out"
</p>
<p>the reason i chose to start jiu jistu is because im a big fan of the ufc and wanted to learn some of the fundimentals of fighting from the ground
that i see all my favourite fighters do.
