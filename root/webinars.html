<h3>what i got from them </h3>
<p>in the plagiarism webinar the lecturer went over what plagiarism is and how to avoid doing it.
		i found it very useful and helped me a great deal when starting my report.
		following on from this the 10 tips for academic writing really help me elevate my academic
		writing with lots of great tips from how to structure my writing but also howto plan out what im writing.
		before completing these 2 webinars i didnt really have a very good understanding of academic writing but 
		they really help fill in the gaps in my knowledge.
		</p>
<p> the web assigment surgory session was an online session that went over some tips for our assigment which 
was greatly needed as i found web quite difficult
